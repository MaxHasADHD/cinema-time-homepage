### What is Cinema Time exactly?
Cinema Time is an app that allows you to track what movies you've watched, want to watch, and when they release. There is so much entertainment that it's easy to lose track, especially now since a films release date is so uncertain.

### Core Features:
- **Information** View a movies release date, overview, cast & crew, certification, and ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Trakt.
- **Trakt.tv Sync** Sign in with your Trakt.tv account to sync your history, watchlist, collection, and custom lists with Trakt.
- **Library Import** Import movies from your iTunes library, TodoMovies, IMDb account, or Trakt through the files that each of those export. Depending on the source we can import watch history and ratings.
- **Export to Calendar** Cinema Time can create and manage an iCloud calendar for upcoming films.
- **Link to iTunes store** Open a movie directly in iTunes to purchase or play.
- **Accessibility** Dynamic type and VoiceOver is fully supported.
